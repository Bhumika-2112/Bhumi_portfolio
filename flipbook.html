      <h2> Time </h2>
      <p> Sitting on a chair looking at the window <br>
  Waiting for an unknown person <br>
  To light up my mystery world <br>
  Who can cheer me every now n then <br>
  Shows me the delight universe of joy <br>
  Wanna find the truth of universe with u <br>
  Every day start with waiting for someone new <br>
  Ends up with getting new hopes for next day...!..</p>

      <h2>Those Brown Eyes</h2>
      <p> There was a boy with eyes of brown, <br> 
  His well-set hair never let him down.  <br>
  He walked with grace, and spoke with charm,  <br>
  Radiating warmth like a cozy hearth's warmth.  </p>

 <p> His eyes were deep like a forest glen,  <br>
  And his hair was silky, like satin blend.  <br>
  He wandered about with a gentle grace,  <br>
  His presence was calming, like a warm embrace.  </p>

 <p> In his eyes, you could see a spark,  <br>
  A twinkle that lit up in the dark.  <br>
  kind and gentle, this boy with brown,  <br>
  And his hair was magnificent; a royal crown.  </p>

<p>  His smile was infectious, and his laugh so pure,  <br>
  He cheered up the sad, and made them feel secure.  <br>
  This boy with eyes of brown and well-set hair,  <br>
  Was a joy to behold, a treasure so rare.</p>

      <h2>Why Krishna?</h2>
      <p>The flute must have prayed in a former life,<br>
to earn the grace of resting near your breath. </p>

<p>The peacock feather graces your crown with pride<br>
not by fate, but by the echoes of a past tread.</p>

<p>Butter found bliss in being your delight <br>
perhaps it died a thousand times to earn that right.</p>

<p>The cow stays by your side, calm and true<br>
perhaps in its past life, it longed for someone like you.</p>

<p>And me who weeps, who pleads beneath the sky,<br>
yet no blessing falls why, O why?<br>
Is my longing not loud enough for grace,<br>
or must I still wander, nameless, in this silent space?</p>

      <h2>Will you love me for Eternity?</h2>
      <p>Will you love me for eternity, <br>
Just as the stars in the sky shine brightly?<br>
Will your love burn like the sun,<br>
Never fading or coming undone?</p>

<p>Will you love me when the winds blow cold,<br>
And our bones are weary and old?<br>
Will your love be steadfast and true,<br>
As the skies above are always blue?</p>

<p>Will you love me through the darkest night,<br>
When shadows lurk and fears take flight?<br>
Will your love be the light that guides,<br>
As we journey together side by side?</p>

<p>For if you promise to love me forever,<br>
I'll hold your hand and leave you never.<br>
Our love will be the sweetest melody,<br>
A cherished bond for all eternity.</p>

     <div class="page" id="page5">
      <h2>Kulfi with You</h2>
      <p>Holding hands walking on the streets,<br>
Eating kulfi and sharing sweet treats.<br>
The warmth of love between us two,<br>
Makes everything beautiful and new.</p>

<p>With each step we take along the way,<br>
Our love grows stronger, day by day.<br>
The taste of kulfi on our lips,<br>
Reminds us of our sweet love trips.</p>

<p>As we stroll, our hands interlaced,<br>
Our bond deepens, cannot be erased.<br>
The sweetness of kulfi fades away,<br>
But our love continues to stay.</p>

<p>We walk and talk without a care,<br>
With love and kulfi, we make a perfect pair.<br>
Our hearts entwined, forever together,<br>
Our bond stronger than any weather.</p>

     <div class="page" id="page6">
      <h2>Celestial Love</h2>
      <p>Celestial love of you and me,<br>
A match that was simply meant to be.<br>
In the vast expanse of the universe so wide,<br>
We found each other, side by side.</p>

<p>Our love is like the stars up high,<br>
Shimmering bright in the midnight sky.<br>
With each beat of our hearts, a new constellation is born,<br>
A symbol of our love, forever adorned.</p>

<p>The moon is jealous of our love so true,<br>
For it knows that it cannot compare to you.<br>
Your beauty is like the sun's bright light,<br>
Heating my heart with each passing night.</p>

<p>Celestial love of you and me,<br>
A bond that will last eternally.<br>
Guided by the cosmos, we'll stay forever entwined,<br>
Our love a reflection of the universe in our minds.</p>

     <div class="page" id="page7">
      <h2>Afterlife</h2>
      <p>As we journey through eternity,<br>
Together forever, you and me.<br>
Our love won't fade, it will never die,<br>
We'll be together in the afterlife.</p>

<p>In this world, we faced so much strife,<br>
But now we're free, in the afterlife.<br>
We'll walk hand in hand, on fields of gold,<br>
Our love will never grow old.</p>

<p>Our souls entwined in eternal love,<br>
We'll soar on wings, like a soaring dove.<br>
Our journey's end, our spirits arise,<br>
Together forever, in the afterlife.</p>

      <h2>HER</h2>
      <p>In the garden of emotions, she does roam,<br>
A sweet girl with a heart, like a fragile poem.</p>

<p>Tears cascade from eyes, like morning dew,<br>
Yet she's the sweetheart of all, through and through.</p>

<p>Her tears, like rain, quench the earth of sorrow,<br>
Each drop a story, of today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>She wears her heart, so openly on her sleeve,<br>
A silent strength, through which we believe.</p>

<p>A gentle touch, a listening ear, she gives,<br>
In her compassion, every heart forgives.</p>

<p>She carries the weight of the world's despair,<br>
Yet offers smiles and kindness, beyond compare.</p>

<p>Her tears, a testament to her love and grace,<br>
In her presence, all pain finds its safe space.</p>

<p>The sweetness in her heart, a pure delight,<br>
Even through the darkest hours of the night.</p>

<p>For she's the sweetheart of all, in every way,<br>
A guiding star through the darkest of days.</p>

<p>Her tears may flow, but so does her love's art,<br>
In her tender soul, she's a work of the heart.</p>
