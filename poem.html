      <div class="poem-title">Those Brown Eyes</div>
      <div class="poem-body">
        There was a boy with eyes of brown,  
        His well-set hair never let him down.  
        He walked with grace, and spoke with charm,  
        Radiating warmth like a cozy hearth's warmth.  

        His eyes were deep like a forest glen,  
        And his hair was silky, like satin blend.  
        He wandered about with a gentle grace,  
        His presence was calming, like a warm embrace.  

        In his eyes, you could see a spark,  
        A twinkle that lit up in the dark.  
        kind and gentle, this boy with brown,  
        And his hair was magnificent; a royal crown.  

        His smile was infectious, and his laugh so pure,  
        He cheered up the sad, and made them feel secure.  
        This boy with eyes of brown and well-set hair,  
        Was a joy to behold, a treasure so rare.

        When the night is long and the stars don‚Äôt show,
        I‚Äôll be the silence where your heart can go.
        No storm too loud, no road too wide,
      If you stand alone‚ÄîI‚Äôll stand beside.

        I spoke to the dark, and it answered me,  
        In rhymes of ruin and melody.  
        It knew my name, it knew my pain,  
        And echoed it back like a soft refrain.
